# Poké-Flautists

This project is about exploring the world of APIs available to us. The app created through this project is an interactive Pokedex, that takes data from Pokemon API to display the first 500 Pokemons listed on the National Pokedex. When a user hovers their mouse over a Pokemon, its details are display. The list displayed can be changed by the type of each Pokemon using the drop-down menu.

Click on the `Display Type` drop down menu to select a particular type that you want to display from the 18 shown on the display. After selection, the list will change to display on the Pokemon who share that as their primary type.
